# BinnBash Website (Starter)

Collaborative website starter repo for practicing real-world GitHub flow:
- Issues → Branches → Pull Requests → Reviews
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Auto-deploy to GitHub Pages

## Quick Start
1) Clone this repo and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo>
   git checkout -b feat/hero-section
   ```
2) Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`; commit and push.
3) Open a Pull Request, link an Issue, request a review.
4) Merging to `main` triggers deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Repo Hygiene
- Branch protection on `main` (require PR + status checks)
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:` ...)
- Use Issues + labels + Projects/Milestones
